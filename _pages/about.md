Two-Stage Noise-Reduced Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Ray Images Using Denoising Autoencoder–CNN Integration.
======
Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide, with chest X-ray imaging serving as a
primary tool for early diagnosis. However, the presence of noise,
artifacts, and low-quality acquisitions significantly degrades im-
age interpretability and limits the effectiveness of automated deep
learning–based detection systems. Conventional convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) are particularly sensitive to such degra-
dations, leading to reduced classification reliability. To address
this limitation, we propose a hybrid deep learning framework
that integrates a denoising autoencoder (DAE) with a CNN for
robust pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The DAE
is trained to reconstruct clean images from noisy inputs, enabling
the suppression of noise while preserving diagnostically relevant
features, and is subsequently coupled with a CNN classifier in a
unified pipeline. The proposed model is evaluated on the publicly
available Kaggle chest X-ray dataset using data augmentation,
class-weighted loss, and early stopping to mitigate class imbalance
and overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that the DAE-
CNN framework consistently outperforms a CNN-only baseline,
achieving an accuracy of 92.9%, an F1-score of 94.6%, and a
balanced accuracy of 90.9%, compared to 86.1% accuracy and
an F1-score of 89.8% obtained without denoising. These results
highlight the effectiveness of incorporating learnable denoising
into deep learning pipelines and underscore its potential for
improving the robustness and reliability of automated pneumonia
detection in clinical imaging scenarios.
